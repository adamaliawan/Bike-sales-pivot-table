# Bike Sales Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on utilizing Excel's pivot table functionality to analyze bike sales data. The dataset contains information about bike sales across various regions, product categories, and customer demographics. The project demonstrates the power of pivot tables in summarizing large datasets to derive valuable business insights.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are:
- To showcase the use of Excel pivot tables for data analysis.
- To provide insights into bike sales, such as revenue, profit, and customer demographics.
- To demonstrate Excel's capabilities in summarizing and filtering data effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed sales data for a bike retail business, including transaction details, customer demographics, and product information.

### Key Columns:
- **Sales Order #**: Unique identifier for each sales order.
- **Date**: The transaction date.
- **Customer Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Age Group**: Categorized age group of the customer.
- **Customer Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Country / State**: Location details of the transaction.
- **Product Category / Sub-Category**: Classification of the products sold.
- **Product Description**: Detailed description of the products sold.
- **Order Quantity**: Number of units sold in each transaction.
- **Unit Cost**: Cost per unit of the product.
- **Unit Price**: Sale price per unit of the product.
- **Profit**: Profit earned from the transaction.
- **Cost**: Total cost of the transaction.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the transaction.

## Key Pivot Table Features

In this project, I used Excel pivot tables to:
- **Summarize sales performance** by product category, sub-category, and region (country/state).
- **Analyze customer demographics**, such as age group and gender distribution, to identify key customer segments.
- **Calculate total revenue, profit, and sales** per product category and region.
- **Compare performance metrics** across different time periods (monthly or yearly).

### Example Pivot Table Insights:
- **Top-performing products**: Identifying the best-selling bikes and accessories.
- **Regional sales analysis**: Breaking down sales performance by country and state to understand geographical trends.
- **Customer segmentation**: Analyzing sales by customer age group and gender to uncover key demographics.

## How to View the Project
- Download the Excel file from this repository.
- Open the file in Excel and explore the pivot tables provided.
- Use the filters in the pivot tables to dive deeper into specific product categories, regions, or customer demographics.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding visualizations (charts and graphs) based on the pivot table results to create a comprehensive dashboard.
- Automating the pivot table creation process using VBA (macros).
- Expanding the dataset to include more variables such as marketing spend or customer feedback for deeper analysis.
